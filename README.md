ðŸ”­ I am Avery Newkirk, I am currently persuing my Bachlors in Computer Science as a non-traditional student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Welcome!

âš¡I have a great passion for expanding my knowledge about different programming languages and technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest updates. As a life long learner, its intresting to learn about new open source technologies and how they work. 

ðŸ˜„ Outside of technology, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, playing videogames, and reading manga. My favorite games are always kirby games and currently Jujitsu kaisen is my favorite manga right now.
